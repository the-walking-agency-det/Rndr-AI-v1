## 2024-05-23 - [Modal Accessibility Pattern]
**Learning:** This project lacks a shared `Modal` or `Dialog` component in `src/components/ui`. Developers are creating custom modals (like `CreateCampaignModal`) that often miss standard accessibility features (Escape key, backdrop click, focus management).
**Action:** When working on modals in this repo, always manually verify and implement: 1. `useEffect` for 'Escape' key. 2. `onClick` handler for backdrop closing (checking `e.target === e.currentTarget`). 3. `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`. 4. `autoFocus` on the first interactive element.
