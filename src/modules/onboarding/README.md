# Onboarding Module

## Purpose

The Onboarding Module guides new users through the initial setup of their account and workspace. It collects essential information to personalize the experience and sets up the user's brand kit.

## Key Components

### `OnboardingFlow`

The main container for the multi-step onboarding process.

### `BrandKitSetup`

A step in the onboarding process where users define their brand colors, fonts, and logo. This data is stored and used to customize AI generations.

### `PersonaSelection`

Allows users to select their primary role (e.g., Creator, Marketer, Musician) to tailor the UI.
