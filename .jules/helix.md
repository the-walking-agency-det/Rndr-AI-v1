## 2024-05-23 - [Genetic Defect: Self-Crossover in Small Populations]
**Learning:** When using Tournament Selection with a small population (e.g., < 10) and a high Tournament Size (e.g., 3), the probability of selecting the same agent as both `parent1` and `parent2` is extremely high. This leads to "Self-Crossover" (Asexual Reproduction), which dramatically reduces genetic diversity and effectively bypasses the benefits of crossover logic.
**Action:** In future engine iterations, enforce `parent1 !== parent2` during selection, or implement a "Sexual Selection" penalty for self-breeding. For now, tests must account for this behavior by using larger populations or explicitly testing for self-crossover resilience.
