### [2024-05-23] ⚡ Bolt UI: Unified CampaignCard styles
- **What:** Unified the Marketing Campaign Card styles.
- **The Palette:** Applied `dept-marketing` (#E91E63) and `dept-campaign` (#FF7043) tokens.
- **Visual Friction Found:** Hardcoded generic purples and pinks (`purple-500`, `pink-500`) in `CampaignCard.tsx` clashed with the strict Marketing Department Magenta identity.
- **Visual Impact:** Aligned the card visual hierarchy with the Global Department Registry.
- **The Vibe Check:** Marketing now feels "Loud & Magenta" consistent with the Brand Book.
