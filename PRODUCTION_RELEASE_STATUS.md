## 🎯 Known Issues (Non-Critical)

### Minor Issues (Do Not Block Release)

1. **Test Coverage:** 85% (acceptable for alpha release)
   - Critical paths covered
   - Payment flows need additional tests (deferred to beta)

2. **Bundle Size:** Essentia WASM is 2.6MB
   - Acceptable for music analysis feature
   - Using Code Splitting already
   - Future: Lazy load Essentia only when needed

3. **Debug Statements:** 70+ console statements in codebase
   - All removed in production build (terser.drop_console)
   - Non-blocking for deployment
   - Can be cleaned up post-release
